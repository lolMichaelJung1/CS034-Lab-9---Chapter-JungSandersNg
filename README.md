## Binary Tree

Task:

Write a Python program that defines a binary tree using a Node class and constructs the
following tree:

mathematica

A / \ B C / \ \ D E F

Create the tree structure in code using Node objects.
Implement the following recursive traversals:

-Preorder
-Inorder
-Postorder
-Print the result of each traversal on the sample tree.

## Binary Search Tree

Task:

Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the following operations:
-insert(value)
-search(value)
-remove(value)
-inorder() traversal to verify structure

## AVL Insertion

-Implement AVL Tree insertion for the same list: 50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80
-Ensure the tree self-balances by applying rotations
